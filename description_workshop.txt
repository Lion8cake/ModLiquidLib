[h1] Welcome to ModLiquid Library! [/h1]
[hr][/hr]

Have you ever wanted to create a modded liquid, but realised that tmodloader lacks support for custom liquids?
This mod is for you!

This mod is a library to be used by mods and developers to allow for the creation of modded liquids. This mod adds no additional content.

This mod handles implementation of liquids in the same way how tmodloader handles modded tiles and walls.

This mod also handles and provides a very wide range of hooks and fields for developers to do whatever they desire with liquids ingame, whether than be adding or editing a liquid to the game.

[h3]QnA:[/h3]

[i][b]What about the 4 liquid, liquid limit?[/b][/i]
That has been expanded to 64, allowing modders a whole 59 new liquids to work with.

[i][b]What is the .TLMap file in player folders?[/b][/i]
This file is handled just for map data for liquids, standing as Tmodloader Liquid Map file. When moving players, please move this file as well to keep liquid map data.

[i][b]How compatable is this with other mods?[/b][/i]
Be careful and aware of other mods that edit or add liquids, as this mod heavily edits everything liquid related in Terraria.
Most mods will work with this library but for mods that don't, please report on the github linked above.
For mods incompatable, do not harrass developers to fix incompatabilities, only ask once and ask politely.
