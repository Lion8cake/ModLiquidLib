[h1] Welcome to ModLiquid Library! [/h1]
[hr][/hr]

Have you ever wanted to create a modded liquid, but realised that tmodloader lacks support for custom liquids?
This mod is for you!

This mod is a library to be used by mods and developers to allow for the creation of modded liquids. 
[b]This mod adds no additional content by itself![/b]

This mod handles implementation of liquids in the same way how tmodloader handles modded tiles and walls.

This mod also handles and provides a very wide range of hooks and fields for developers to do whatever they desire with liquids ingame, whether than be adding or editing a liquid to the game.

This mod adds tools for developers to allow them to do the following:
[list]
    [*]Create custom liquids
    [*]Edit existing or other modded liquids
    [*]Do more with Waterfalls
    [*]Do more with Tiles
[/list]

This library is also an early look into 1.4.5's Modded Liquid system hopefully coming to tmodloader. Using this library will help the development of this system coming to tmodloader.
If you want to read more about this library being merged into tmodloader itself, you can read it in the FAQ section.

I have a Ko-fi where you can help donate to me as a mod developer as I continue working on this library and other mods.
If you can't support me financially, leaving a positive review and sharing this to other mod developers can help me out a lot as well!

Although this library doesn't add any content, there are still a few mods out on the workshop that do use this library to add new modded liquids for you to try out!

[h3]QnA:[/h3]

[i][b]What about the 4 liquid, liquid limit?[/b][/i]
That has been expanded to 64, allowing modders a whole 59 new liquids to work with.

[i][b]What is the .TLMap file in player folders?[/b][/i]
This file is handled just for map data for liquids, standing as Tmodloader Liquid Map file. When moving players, please move this file as well to keep liquid map data.

[i][b]Is this mod coming to native tmodloader?[/b][/i]
Yes, this mod currently has a PR drafted up ready to be added in 1.4.5. This means that this mod will eventually become legacy and only supported for 1.4.4 versions of tmodloader.
Until 1.4.5, this mod will be maintained to be up to date with all the features the PR has.
If you want to support the PR and have a github account, you can show support by visiting the PR below and reacting to it with either a thumbs up or rocket.

[i][b]How compatable is this with other mods?[/b][/i]
Be careful and aware of other mods that edit or add liquids, as this mod heavily edits everything liquid related in Terraria.
Most mods will work with this library but for mods that don't, please report on the github linked above.
For mods incompatable, do not harrass developers to fix incompatabilities, only ask once and ask politely.
