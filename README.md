## Welcome to ModLiquid Library!
This library aims to have a concise and consistent way of implementing liquids for other mods while also sticking to similar implementation of other tmodloader content such as ModTiles and ModWalls.

For example, creating a liquid should be just as easy as making a tile or wall, using SetStaticDefaults for settings and map entries, using the various pre/post draws and updates for rendering and actions as well as other various miscellaneous methods for your needs

The Library will include:
* ModLiquid
* GlobalLiquid
* ModLiquidFall (an updated and expanded upon ModWaterfallStyle, used for more than just water styles)

When finished this mod will be uploaded to the Tmodloader workshop for mods to use alongside with. This mod is VERY early in development only have the bare basics for liquid support although has enough for developers to start to play around with making their own liquids for their mods.

FaQ:

### When will it be released?

When its ready!


### Will this change or add anything extra to the game outside of just liquid support?

No. Stuff like ModLiquidFall are added because tmodloader has a lack of support for those areas and need to be brought up to speed so that everything is on an even playing field


### Can I contribute?

Sure, make sure you make a fork and then PR to the project so I (Lion8cake) am able to review all changes to make sure that everything will work.


### Why is this a mod?

A long list of reasons such as Tmodloader standards, the time for a PR to get accepted, the freedom I have with modding, and the biggest is the challenge I'm faced with making this a mod


### Wiki on how to use this library?

An extensive wiki on ModLiquid, GlobalLiquid and more will be made, but after a few days after the initial release.


### Am I able to download and use this mod?

For a normal player I wouldn't recommend since this only adds modding tools to developers, for developers and players using this mod for other experimental mods, sure although until full release expect issues.


### I've found an issue, where do I report?

Report it in the Issues section of this github, there isn't anywhere else outside of contacting me personally (Lion8cake on discord) and I would much prefer all issues are in 1 concise area rather than in random DMs or discord servers
